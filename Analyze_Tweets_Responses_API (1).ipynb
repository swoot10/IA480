    "\n",
    "- **Connecting to a MongoDB database** to store and retrieve tweets.\n",
    "- **Extracting tweets** and converting them into a structured format for further analysis.\n",
    "- **Creating a vector store** and uploading tweets for semantic search.\n",
    "- **Using file search** to analyze private datasets.\n",
    "- **Performing web search** to retrieve the latest public information.\n",
    "- **Utilizing stateful responses** to maintain conversation context.\n",
    "- **Combining file and web search** to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, users will be able to integrate OpenAI's Responses API for efficient data retrieval \n",
    "and analysis of structured and unstructured data."

       "4. **Climate and Energy**: The party is skeptical of climate change policies, opposing measures like the phasing out of coal and the focus on renewable energy sources. They advocate for affordable energy policies, often supporting nuclear and coal energy.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Security and Law Enforcement**: The AfD promotes increased funding for police and security services, tougher sentencing for crimes, and stricter laws regarding national security.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Education**: They support a more traditional approach to education, emphasizing national culture and history, and are critical of perceived leftist ideologies in schools.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Family and Gender**: The AfD supports traditional family structures and is critical of gender mainstreaming. They advocate for policies incentivizing higher birth rates among native Germans.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **Economic Policy**: The party promotes free-market principles, reducing taxes, and lowering government intervention in the economy.\n",
       "\n",

    "This capability is particularly useful for obtaining up-to-date data, fact-checking, and expanding knowledge \n",
    "without relying solely on pre-trained information. \n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging OpenAI's web search functionality, the Responses API can fetch external data \n",
    "and provide accurate, relevant results in real time (OpenAI, 2025). \n",
    "This feature enhances applications that require the latest insights, such as news aggregation, research, \n",
    "or dynamic content generation.\n",
